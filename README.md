#Katana

I've decided to release Katana code under GPL license.
I love Java, but I prefer iOS/OSX development over Android.
I will continue to push updates to the Google Play Store.
If you want to contribute, just send a pull request.
You will be given credit, of course.

#ToDos

- Add licenses
- Add ACRA and DirectoryFileChooser as submodules

#Notes

Remember to compile the native library

Assuming that NDK folder is on your PATH:

	cd $KATANA_DIR
	ndk-build
